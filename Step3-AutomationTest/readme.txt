# Prerequisites
Chrome browser version is: Version 124.0.6367.62 (Official Build) (x86_64)
I developed and tested the script in Mac OS but this should work in Windows OS as well. (Pipenv is a Python virtualenv management tool that supports a multitude of systems)
pip (package installer for Python)

#Setting up the environment
1. pip3 install pipenv
2. pipenv shell (It should launch a virtual environment & create a Pipfile)
3. pipenv install selenium (It'll create Pipfile.lock)
4. python script.py (The browser should open with the URL and should start executing the script automatically)
