This is the vanilla JS script to click the “Enquire now” button and fill up the form with random values. I've cover all the conditions that are mentioned in the problem statement.
One thing that I couldn't cover is that to make the form submitted after fill it up. Manually it's working fine but I don't know why it's not working when an automation script is filling up the form.

I've tried some ways to click it.
1. Force fully.
2. By removing the disabled attribute from DOM

But the two of the mentioned approaches did not help.

I still believe this can be done but I'll need more time for that.

Otherwise the script is working fine.

To run the script please use Google Chrome. I didn't get the time to test the script with other browsers. My current chrome version is: Version 124.0.6367.62 (Official Build) (x86_64)

Note: I've added a screendump of running the script in the folder.
